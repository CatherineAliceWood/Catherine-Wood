### My Personal Website

## Learning notes

- used '>' in CSS selectors to target elements more precisely
- used 'pt' for font sizes to make sure they are readible across all devices
- used 'vw' / 'vh' for padding and margins to make sure they resize for different viewport sizes
- inspected the page a lot with dev tools to figure out what Bootstrap classes were affecting styling and how to edit them
